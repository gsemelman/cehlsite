	<p class="small-paragraph text-left">The playoffs are coming the playoffs are coming!!!!! After an great season, the playoff positions are set and the exciting playoff race begins!</p>
	
	<p class="small-paragraph text-left">You may notice the site is a little different. You can find the playoff tree on the front page and the standings page. All of the roster pages also reflect
	your playoff lineup. For now if you need to see the season scoring results, you can go view the old site. Season history will be added for next season.</p>	
	
	<p class="small-paragraph text-left">It's also time for teams that did not make the playoffs to wipe away their tears and look ahead to the draft. We will be holding a lottery draft
	for the top 3 picks for the upcomming draft (2017 NHL Draft) during the playoffs. More details to come! </p>
	
	<p class="small-paragraph text-left">As for the rest of you bums, we will get things started once the playoff preview is sent out.</p>
	
	<p class="small-paragraph text-left">Good luck everyone!</p>
