	<p class="small-paragraph text-left">The season has started, and the Oilers and Rangers are both off to hot starts while leading their respective conferences</p>
	
	<p class="small-paragraph text-left">There have also been some surprising starts, perennial contenders Anaheim and Chicago are off to shaky starts, 
	while the so called tankers the Calgary flames are having trouble losing games. St Louis with their rag tag youth driven team has also seen a great start to the season</p>
		
	<p class="small-paragraph text-left">The site continues to see changes for the better, with a brand new boxscore page, along with general theming of the website. Please send
	your complaints to CEHL PR representative Josh Gordon should you not like anything.</p>
