	<p class="medium-paragraph">The Washington Capitals have been crowned season 26 Smitty Cup Champions!!!</p>
	

	<p class="small-paragraph text-left">After a long battle of wills, sweat, tears, and possibly dark motives, 
	 the Washington Capitals have won the smitty cup for the first time in franchise history. </p>
	
	<p class="small-paragraph text-left">In a weird turn of events, Anaheim GM Dan Rudd was ejected from the Game 7 final for attempting to throw rocks from his box seats
	on capitals players in retribution for the gooning of Patrick Kane earlier in the series. We attempted to reach out to Caps GM Grant Semelman
	for comment, but he would not return our phone calls. He was later spotted hiding under his office desk with tears of joy, eating pie 
	with a mysterious white powder on his face. The Capitals PR team also declined to comment.</p>	
	
	<p class="small-paragraph text-left">Entering the offseason there is still much to do. FA is on the horizon, but first the much anticipated
	 CEHL draft will take place Sunday January 6th at 1PM. </p>
	
	<p class="small-paragraph text-left">You can either navigate to the draft page and find the 'Enter 2017 Draft' button, or you can follow the link below.</p>

	<p class="small-paragraph text-left">Good luck to those of you with picks!</p>
