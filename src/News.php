	<p class="small-paragraph text-left">All Star weekend continues with the main event!</p>
	
	<p class="small-paragraph text-left">The game started off with a bang, with Sidney Crosby and the West coming out strong in the first period with 18 shots on net.</p>
		
	<p class="small-paragraph text-left">The East was able to weather the storm and came out of the period tied 3-3 with Matthews, Pietrangelo and Malkin scoring on limited chances</p>
	
	<p class="small-paragraph text-left">The East turned the tides in period 2, keeping the Western All Stars to 4 shots and pounding 12 of their own against the Western side.</p>
	
	<p class="small-paragraph text-left">Alex Ovechkin opened the scoring, but Matt Duchene managed to tie it all up in the dying minutes of the 2nd with the score tied 4-4</p>
	
	<p class="small-paragraph text-left">The third period saw the gameplay reduce to KHL standards with only 11 shots between both teams. David Krejci scored the game winning goal with under 6 minutes remaining in the period securing the win for the Eastern conference!</p>

	<p class="small-paragraph text-left">Final Score: Eastern Conference <strong>5</strong> Western Conference <strong>4</strong></p>
	
	<p class="small-paragraph text-left">Malkin(1), Duchene(2) and Crosby(3) were the 3 Stars of the game</p>
	
	<p class="small-paragraph text-left">After the game, Edmonton GM Andrew Bradley could be heard grumbling something about the travesty of the East being better than the West before scrambling to return home on a flight to NB to make sure no kids were on his lawn.</p>
