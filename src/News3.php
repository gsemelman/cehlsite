						<h5>EASTERN CONFERENCE</h5>

						<br>

						<p class="medium-paragraph text-left">
							<strong>RANGERS(4) @ WASHINGTON(1)</strong>
						</p>

						<p class="small-paragraph text-left">The Rangers enter the second round after taking down another eastern juggernaut in the Carolina Hurricanes in 7 games. Unlike the last round, the defending cup champions will have their hands full against a stacked Rangers squad. The Rangers won the season series with a 1-1 record, but both these teams have great lineups and fireworks are expected. The key to the series could be goaltending with Henrik Lundqvist playing like his old playoff dominating self. Can he keep it up? Or will Andrei Vasilevskiy steal the show?</p>
						<p class="small-paragraph text-left">
							<strong>Prediction: Rangers in 6</strong>
						</p>
						<p class="small-paragraph text-left">
							<strong>Commish Prediction: Caps in 9! It will only take 2 re-sims for the caps to take down the rangers in 7!</strong>
						</p>
						<br>

						<p class="medium-paragraph text-left">
							<strong>PITTSBURGH(2) @ NEW JERSEY(3)</strong>
						</p>

						<p class="small-paragraph text-left">Both these teams powered their way to the second round with fine play by their respective first lines. Devil’s GM Shawn Lawrence thinks his team has the chance to go all the way this year but will not take the talented Pittsburgh squad whom finished 2nd in the conference for granted. The season series between these two rivals was fairly even with Pittsburgh taking the season series at 4-3-1, so expect this series to be close. This one could come down to which team can shut down the opposing team’s first line.</p>

						<p class="small-paragraph text-left">
							<strong>Prediction: Devils in 6</strong>
						</p>
						<p class="small-paragraph text-left">
							<strong>Commish Prediction: Fuck New Jersey! Pittsburgh in 6!</strong>
						</p>
						<br>


						<h5>WESTERN CONFERENCE</h5>
						<br>

						<p class="medium-paragraph text-left">
							<strong>DALLAS(4) @ SAN JOSE(1)</strong>
						</p>

						<p class="small-paragraph text-left">The Presidents' trophy winners continue to roll and will take on the top-heavy Dallas stars whom are coming off an impressive first round series win vs the Wild. Dallas GM Devin Decastro says his team started off shaky last round but switched into a different gear once Brad Marchand returned for injury. San Jose dominated the season series 6-2, but the Stars have top line talent that always seems to dominate in the playoffs. San Jose GM Tyler Hetherington is still confident the team he has assemble go take down the Stars and believes they have holes that can be exploited. Carey Price was impressive in the first round and must continue with his great play for the Sharks to take down the Stars.</p>
						<p class="small-paragraph text-left">
							<strong>Prediction: Sharks in 7</strong>
						</p>
						<p class="small-paragraph text-left">
							<strong>Commish Prediction: Marchand goons his way into the conference finals, Stars in 6</strong>
						</p>
						<br>

						<p class="medium-paragraph text-left">
							<strong>NASHVILLE(3) @ EDMONTON(1)</strong>
						</p>

						<p class="small-paragraph text-left">As expected McJesus dominated in his first-round matchup putting up 7 goals in 5 games against a powerhouse Ducks team. Nashville lead by Alex Ovechkin had a great season but will be in tough vs a very tough Oilers squad. Nashville will have to start the series without their playoff leading scorer Jakub Vrana who was injured in the last game of the first round. Nashville had a great season, but they might have met their match against a very complete Oilers team. </p>
						<p class="small-paragraph text-left">
							<strong>Prediction: Edmonton in 6</strong>
						</p>
						<p class="small-paragraph text-left">
							<strong>Commish Prediction: Nobody likes giving a vote of confidence to an Albertan city…. but Edmonton will win this series and in short order. Oilers in 5.</strong>

						<h5>EASTERN CONFERENCE</h5>

						<br>

						<p class="medium-paragraph text-left">
							<strong>MONTREAL(8) @ WASHINGTON(1)</strong>
						</p>

						<p class="small-paragraph text-left">In what could be the least
							inspiring matchup of the CEHL playoffs, the defending Smitty Cup
							champions take on what now looks to be a low-end BCHL team. Not
							much is expected from the habs at this point as they are a team
							depleted of talent, coaching and overall leadership. The key to
							the series for the habs will be sticking to their game, setting
							the tone with some big hits and containing the top Washington
							lines. The key to the series for Washington will be.... showing
							up.</p>
						<p class="small-paragraph text-left">
							<strong>Prediction: Caps in 5</strong>
						</p>
						<p class="small-paragraph text-left">
							<strong>Commish Prediction: Caps in 0, Montreal is a no show and
								starts their golfing season early.</strong>
						</p>
						<br>

						<p class="medium-paragraph text-left">
							<strong>TORONTO(7) @ PITTSBURGH(2)</strong>
						</p>

						<p class="small-paragraph text-left">This series is a surprise to
							everyone. Pittsburgh, while a playoff calibre team, has proven
							everyone wrong and pushed for top seed in the East ultimately
							finishing second. Toronto also took the league by surprise and
							climbed into a playoff spot late. As a testament to how horrible
							the North East division really is, the Leafs took the division
							title finishing 7th in the East.</p>
						<p class="small-paragraph text-left">This series comes down to
							depth versus elites. Few teams boast the depth and well-rounded
							roster that the Penguins ice. However, the Leafs have Austin
							Matthews and Sergei Bobrovsky that stand out above and beyond the
							rest. The two teams played each other only twice with each
							getting a win.</p>
						<p class="small-paragraph text-left">The Pens have been one of the
							top offensive and defensive teams in the east all season but
							serious questions have arisen if GM Mike Osterloh is just too
							damn nice to do what needs to be done in the playoffs. We know GM
							Kostovoski is the type of guy who isn't afraid to break any rule
							and goon it up, so don't be surprised if we see some shenanigans
							from that front office.</p>

						<p class="small-paragraph text-left">
							<strong>Prediction: Evander Kane takes a run at Matthews and
								ruins Toronto's shot at a Cinderella run. Youngsters Barzal and
								Aho take a step toward superstardom in this series and starts
								the Penguins off on a journey that leads to the Conference
								Finals. Penguins in 5.</strong>
						</p>
						<p class="small-paragraph text-left">
							<strong>Commish Prediction: Toronto keeps it close, but just like
								the real life version of their club, they fall in 7 in the first
								round.</strong>
						</p>
						<br>

						<p class="medium-paragraph text-left">
							<strong>FLORIDA(6) @ NEW JERSEY(3)</strong>
						</p>

						<p class="small-paragraph text-left">Florida returns to the
							playoffs after a long wait with a revamped youth driven core.
							This is GM Mike Clark's first foray into the world of CEHL
							playoffs, but his expectations are still high. In the other
							corner we have the Devils whom were part of the eastern
							conference arms race leading up to the deadline. The season
							series was tied at one a piece with both teams putting up 9 goals
							so this series could go either way. The devils will look to get
							out of the first round for the first time a few seasons. While
							the devils have the better team on paper, the panthers should not
							be underestimated. The battle of the current and former
							bramptonites could be fierce, with multiple stabbings and failed
							drug tests expected.</p>
						<p class="small-paragraph text-left">
							<strong>Prediction: Devils in 6</strong>
						</p>
						<p class="small-paragraph text-left">
							<strong>Commish Prediction: Florida gets hot and the devils
								continue to struggle in the playoffs. Panthers in 6.</strong>
						</p>
						<br>

						<p class="medium-paragraph text-left">
							<strong>(5)CAROLINA @ NEW YORK RANGERS(4)</strong>
						</p>

						<p class="small-paragraph text-left">This one could be a doozy. In
							what could be a series for the ages, this matchup will see two
							powerhouse teams with a combined 27 players with 80 OV+ ratings
							which should put a lot of cash in the pockets of both teams. The
							teams split the season series at 1-1 with little separation
							between the two. This is Carolina's first playoff berth in
							franchise history, so expectations will be high, but the pressure
							is all on the Rangers who have gone all in and expect nothing
							less than a cup victory. The Rangers are the better team on
							paper, but the last third of the season was marred by controversy
							after a bunch of trade deadline moves resulted in not being able
							to buy a game.</p>
						<p class="small-paragraph text-left">
							<strong>Prediction: Rangers in 7</strong>
						</p>
						<p class="small-paragraph text-left">
							<strong>Commish Prediction: Canes in 7, Rangers will follow in
								the footsteps of the great Dave Herr and bow out early in the
								playoffs even with the best team on paper.</strong>
						</p>
						<br> <br>

						<h5>WESTERN CONFERENCE</h5>
						<br>

						<p class="medium-paragraph text-left">
							<strong>COLUMBUS(8) @ SAN JOSE(1)</strong>
						</p>

						<p class="small-paragraph text-left">Presidents' trophy winners
							San Jose are entering the first round on a major high with one of
							the better seasons a team has had in recent memory. Holding a
							record of 11-2 since the trade deadline and putting together
							multiple win streaks during the regular season, Columbus has a
							tough road ahead no matter how you look at it. Holtby could steal
							a game at some point in this series but expect Carey Price to be
							Carey Price early on in this one.</p>
						<p class="small-paragraph text-left">
							<strong>Prediction: Sharks in 5</strong>
						</p>
						<p class="small-paragraph text-left">
							<strong>Commish Prediction: Columbus comes up with an upset and
								takes it in 7 on the back of Braden Holtby..</strong>
						</p>
						<br>

						<p class="medium-paragraph text-left">
							<strong>ANAHEIM(7) @ EDMONTON(2)</strong>
						</p>

						<p class="small-paragraph text-left">One of the more intriguing
							matchups in round 1, the Oilers and Ducks are not shy when it
							comes to Smitty Cup runs. Edmonton once again proved they are a
							force with McJesus leading the way along with one of the best D
							cores in the league. Patrick Kane, Phil the Thrill and the
							veteran core of the Ducks will have something to say about it,
							especially after coming one win shy of the cup last year. This
							one could come down to goaltending in the end.</p>
						<p class="small-paragraph text-left">
							<strong>Prediction: Oilers in 7</strong>
						</p>
						<p class="small-paragraph text-left">
							<strong>Commish Prediction: 3-3 TIE; Teams are involved in an
								in-air collision taking down the planes of both teams and their
								entire staff. In an unrelated note, we will need two more GM's.</strong>
						</p>
						<br>

						<p class="medium-paragraph text-left">
							<strong>CHICAGO(6) @ NASHVILLE(3)</strong>
						</p>

						<p class="small-paragraph text-left">The 3-6 matchup in the West
							proves to be a close one as these two teams were separated by
							only 4 points. Struggling out of the gate this season, the
							Blackhawks saw some consistency come into their game leading to
							yet another playoff berth in the tough Western Conference. The
							Preds were a different story as they remained near the top of the
							Western Conference since the start, which could be considered one
							of the biggest headlines in the league this year as this was done
							without a GM running the show. The Rocket Richard Trophy winner
							Alex Ovechkin has not missed a beat all season, dominating his
							competition, but a grueling playoff series playing head-to-head
							against the likes of Doughty and Letang will prove too much to
							handle. Ovie and the boys will have to wait yet another year to
							drink from the Smitty Cup.</p>
						<p class="small-paragraph text-left">
							<strong>Prediction: Hawks in 7</strong>
						</p>
						<p class="small-paragraph text-left">
							<strong>Commish Prediction: Preds have been a great story, but
								hawks powered by a great top line and strong D will take it in
								6.</strong>
						</p>

						<br>

						<p class="medium-paragraph text-left">
							<strong>MINNY(5) @ DALLAS(4)</strong>
						</p>

						<p class="small-paragraph text-left">Expect some fireworks in this
							one friends. Reports out of Dallas heading into game 1 is that a
							verbal dispute led to a physical altercation between fellow Nova
							Scotians Sidney Crosby and Nathan MacKinnon outside of the Medusa
							Nightclub where both teams attended to blow off some steam. Brad
							Marchand got knocked out by a sucker punch in one of the most
							ironic scenes in recent time, while Evgeny Kuznetsov was found
							motionless on the bathroom floor with a white powdered substance
							under his nose. Everyone has posted bail and are ready for the
							opener in front of the hostile crowd at the American Airlines
							Arena.</p>
						<p class="small-paragraph text-left">
							<strong> Prediction: Stars in 6</strong>
						</p>
						<p class="small-paragraph text-left">
							<strong>Commish Prediction: Minny in 6 with Dev benching his star
								players in exchange for a pair of babsocks.</strong>
