<p align="left"><a href="./cehlRosters.html#Anaheim"><img src="ducks.gif" width="100" height="38"></a><b>Anaheim
Mighty Ducks &nbsp;&nbsp;</b></p>
<p align="left"><b>Season 1: </b>Coming into season 1 the Anaheim Mighty Ducks
were expected to miss the playoffs and be a building team that would compete
in a few years.&nbsp; However, GM Dan Rudd was able to make some smart trades
and the Ducks were able to compete for a playoff spot in the west, unfortunately
they just fell short.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><b>Offseason:&nbsp;</b> In the offseason the Mighty Ducks
improved their defense immensely, but it came at the cost of losing some
offensive weapons.&nbsp; They were relatively quiet in the Free Agent signings,
but made some trades that will surely impact the team.&nbsp; Out went stars such
as Paul Kariya and Mark Parrish, Jason Alliso, and youngster Martin Skoula.&nbsp; In came
Marion Gaborik, Zdeno Chara, Todd White, Dan Boyle, Maxim Afinagenov, and Darius Kaspiritis.&nbsp;
The Ducks still have some great offensive talent in Gaborik, St. Louis, Peca, Hrdina,
Gratton and despite the trade rumours, still have Lecavalier.&nbsp;
The offense looks like one of the best in the league, and will carry this team.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Youth to Watch:&nbsp; </b>The Ducks have one of the strongest
defenses in the league, and this depth shows from the pro experienced players,
right down to the prospects on the farm.&nbsp; Players like Anton Volchenkov,
Denis Seidenberg, and Kurt Sauer were expecting to get a chance in the CEHL this
year, but with the depth Anaheim has in the pros, these guys will be in the
minors for awhile, or used as trade bait.&nbsp; In net the Ducks have young star
J.S. Giguere that should have a breakout season soon, and in the minors is much
talked about Ilya Bryzgalov that might see some playing time this season.&nbsp;
Up front, the Mighty Ducks are very thin prospect wise, but have some talent on
the pro roster that is young enough to be staying in California for years to
come.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Expectations and Prediction:&nbsp; </b>The Mighty Ducks had a
potent offense in Season 1, and were so close to making it to the
playoffs.&nbsp; This offseason has been a great one for Ducks fans.&nbsp; the
team has got younger and much better.&nbsp; They have some of the best young
stars in the game, a solid a deep defense corps, and one of the best up and
coming goalies, waiting to explode on the scene.&nbsp; Look out for Anaheim at
or near the top of the Western Conference, and look out for them come playoff
time.&nbsp; Some say they are the pre season favourites.&nbsp; <b>3rd in
Pacific.&nbsp; 6th in Western Conference.</b></p>
<p align="left"><a href="./cehlRosters.html#Atlanta"><img src="thrashers.gif" width="100" height="38"></a><b>Atlanta
Thrashers&nbsp;</b></p>
<p align="left"><b>Season 1:</b>&nbsp; The Thrashers signed Mike Ratz as their
first ever CEHL GM, because of the win now attitude he brought.&nbsp; Ratz made
some very good deals to bring Atlanta out of the gutter and into the
playoffs.&nbsp; Throughout the season they were ranked 3-5 in the very
competetive Eastern Conference, until the home stretch when the Thrashers
slumped, and tied Ottawa for the 8th most points, but got into the
playoffs.&nbsp; There they battled hard against a very strong Washington
Capitals team, and without their captain and top defenseman Chris Chelios the
Thrashers fell in 6 games.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Offseason:&nbsp;</b> The Atlanta Thrashers made an unexpected
shakeup in between the pipes in the offseaosn.&nbsp; After trading for Sean
Burke mid way through season 1, the Thrashers signed UFA goalie Manny Fernendez
for 5 seasons, and then shipped Burke off to Los Angelas for some younger
talent.&nbsp; Also, the Thrashers made another deal to land a solid young back
up goalie in Jani Hurme, but lost star defenseman Chris Chelios.&nbsp; Late in
preseason they made a final move to get more powerful with Jason Arnott, as well
as landing blue chip prospect Steven Weiss for Deadmarsh, Young, Brylin and
Taffe.&nbsp; The
Thrashers overall got much younger in the offseason, and likely will not be as
good as they were last season.&nbsp; However, Ratz has kept a good base of
talent, as well as some very good prospects, and may squeak back into the
playoffs.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Youth to Watch:</b>&nbsp; The two big goalie deals that the
Thrashers pulled off, brought in two blue chip prospects to the
organization.&nbsp; Mike Cammalleri came in from Hollywood and is currently on
the pro roster.&nbsp; It was expected that he may step in for the Kings this
season, but may be stuck in the minors for another year, as the Thrashers are
very deep on the wing.&nbsp; Mark Popovic was also acquired in the Chelios
deal.&nbsp; Popovic is currently the teams number 7 defenseman, but could break
into the CEHL this year if the Thrashers decide to go with his offensive upside
over the slightly more defensive Karlis Skrastins or Ossi Vaananen.&nbsp; Do not
expect the Thrashers to start Popovic instead of the recently signed Vaananen,
but if Skrastins' defensive play falters, or Atlanta decides to go with a more
offensive twist, Popovic may begin his CEHL career this season.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Expectations and Prediction:&nbsp;</b> This is in no way the
same team from Season 1.&nbsp; They have lost some good experienced players, but
added some prospects that could break into the CEHL soon.&nbsp; Up front Atlanta
continues to have, what looks to be a tough offense.&nbsp; They are very deep on
the wings with Segei Brylin and Kirk Maltby expected to be 4th liners.&nbsp; On
defense Atlanta is still fairly strong and is now lead by Derian Hatcher.&nbsp;
Manny Fernendez will now take the reigns in net and is backed up by either Jani
Hurme or Pasi Nurminen.&nbsp; These goalies will likely be in Atlanta for a long
time to come.&nbsp; Overall the Thrashers inched their way into the playoffs
last season, and with improvements from almost every Eastern team, the Thrashers
can not afford to have another late season drought.&nbsp; They are capable of
making the playoffs again, but they will have to come to play every single
night.&nbsp; <b>2nd in Southeast.&nbsp; 7th in Eastern Conference.</b></p>
<p align="left"><a href="./cehlRosters.html#Boston"><img src="bruins.gif" width="100" height="38"></a><b>Boston
Bruins&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><b>Season 1:&nbsp;</b> The Bruins were a force in the Eastern Conference all
season long.&nbsp; Early in the year they brought in big names such as Alex
Tanguay, and Adam Foote while losing Sergei Samsonov.&nbsp; They were in a
heated race for the division title with the Toronto Maple Leafs, and in the end
the Leafs beat them out by 1 point.&nbsp; Then came the playoffs when the Bruins
began to shine.&nbsp; In the first round they played a very physical series
against their division rivals the Toronto Maple Leafs, in which they went up 3
games to 1 before letting Toronto send it to game 7 at the ACC, but the Bruins
were able to knock them off.&nbsp; In the second round the Bruins went up 3-1
again against the heavily favoured Washington Capitals.&nbsp; But again the
Bruins were able to win a 7th game on the road.&nbsp; Then it was off to the
Eastern Conference finals where the Bruins finally met their physical and talent
match in the New Jersey Devils.&nbsp; The Devils went on to win the series 4-2,
but the Bruins had gone further than anyone had thought, especially with the
unproven goalie tandem in Steve Shields and Martin Biron leading the way.</p>
<p><b>Offseason:</b>&nbsp; The Bruins stayed quiet in the offseason after having
great success with the current team.&nbsp; The only moves made were to resign
young guns Alex Tanguay and Joe Thornton, as well as experienced defensive
defenseman Don Sweeney.&nbsp; Last season it became well known that management
liked Martin Biron very much and believed he could take on the starting
role.&nbsp; In the playoffs he split time with Steve Shields and it worked
well.&nbsp; It was hard to believe them making it to the third round with those
two goalies, but GM Andrew Decelles has not changed his stance on the teams
goaltender situation, and they will yet again start the season with questions
looming around this position.</p>
<p><b>Youth to Watch:</b>&nbsp; The Bruins are very thin on the prospects
front.&nbsp; However, their pro roster is not deep at center or left wing at all
and that makes it easy for youngsters Kris Vernarsky and Martin Samuelsson to
get a chance in the pros.&nbsp; Vernarsky is coming off a strong rookie season
in which he was considered for the Calder Trophy and will likely start on the
Bruins 4th line.&nbsp; Samuelsson will be in a heated race for 4th line duties
against Rob Zamuner and Michael Grosek.&nbsp; A race he is not expected to
win.&nbsp; Look for Samuelsson to be a substitute for injured players.&nbsp;
Jonathon Girard is a young defenseman that will likely be the Bruins number 6
man.&nbsp; He will get some good ice time and should learn a lot on one of, if
not the best, defense corps in the league.</p>
<p><b>Expectations and Prediction:</b>&nbsp; After last seasons run to the
Eastern Conference finals, expectations for this team are very high.&nbsp; They
are very weak at center, have 2 very skilled left wingers, and 4 solid right
wingers.&nbsp; Obviously offense is not their strong point.&nbsp; The Bruins
made it far last season thanks to some very hard hitting and solid
defensemen.&nbsp; Foote, Gill, O'Donnel, Sweeney, Berard and Girard will be the
starting 6 in front of either Biron or Shields.&nbsp; For the Bruins to have
repeated success they must once again rely on these 6 players.&nbsp; Do not
expect the Bruins to have a season similar to the last one.&nbsp; <b>1st in
Northeast.&nbsp; 1st in Eastern Conference.</b></p>
<p><a href="./cehlRosters.html#Buffalo"><img src="sabres.gif" width="100" height="38"></a><b>Buffalo
Sabres&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><b>Season 1:&nbsp;</b> The Sabres were labeled as a rebuilding team in Season
1 after some trades for some very good young stars were made.&nbsp; They were
relatively close to the playoffs for the first half of the season, but in the
end, they finished near the bottom of the east as was expected.&nbsp; GM Bobby
Banakar has not changed his formula for this team, and will stay patient as they
grow stronger.&nbsp; Don't expect too much from the Sabres again this year, but
with a team full of young potential waiting to explode, you never know what they
are capable of.</p>
<p><b>Offseason:</b>&nbsp; The Sabres lost their starting goalie Chris Osgood to
free agency in the offseason, but were able to pick up Kevin Weekes to replace
him.&nbsp; Also, Buffalo improved their offense with the signing of Viktor
Kozlov who will likely center the teams first line.&nbsp; Pavel Datsyuk and
Jason Williams made a long term bond with the Sabres organization as they agreed
to new contracts to keep them with the team for a few more seasons.&nbsp; Also,
the Sabres traded away veteran defenseman Dmitri Yuskevich and defensive forward
Erik Rasmussen and got even younger by acquiring players such as Josef Vasicek,
Denis Shvidki, and Andrej Nederost.&nbsp; Overall the Sabres defense and
goaltending has been taken down a notch after free agency and a couple of
trades, but the offense is looking stronger, and as usual, the Sabres still have
some young talent that could explode at anytime.</p>
<p><b>Youth to Watch:</b>&nbsp; The Sabres have a lot of youth to keep an eye
out for.&nbsp; Season one saw Nick Boynton and Pavel Datsyuk have breakout CEHL
years which should continue this year.&nbsp; The question is, who will break out
for them this year?&nbsp; Look no further than Vaclav Nederost.&nbsp; Nederost
is listed on hockeysfuture.com's top 50 prospects list, and could center
Buffalo's 3rd or 4th line this year.&nbsp; Also, goalie Ryan Miller has the
potential and experience to have his break out year.&nbsp; Miller will feel less
pressured this season as he will play behind shaky starter Kevin Weekes instead
of veteran Chris Osgood.&nbsp; Miller should see 15-20 games at least this
season, and if his numbers are near those of Weekes', Miller could win the
starting job by the end of the year.</p>
<p><b>Expectations and Prediction:&nbsp;</b> The Sabres will continue their
building up process, and should not be expected to make the playoffs, especially
since the East is looking so competitive this year.&nbsp; The teams defense is
not what it was last season, and with a weaker starting goaltender, that could
hurt them.&nbsp; Up front they have some very good scoring potential and some
tremendous youth.&nbsp; The offense is what must carry this team if they want to
achieve their goal of a .500 season.&nbsp; Buffalo is not the team of now, just
yet. If your a young fan looking for a team to stand beside, Buffalo is the way
to go.&nbsp; They should be a league powerhouse a few seasons down the road.<b>&nbsp;
5th in Northeast.&nbsp; 11th in Eastern Conference.</b></p>
<p><a href="./cehlRosters.html#Calgary"><img src="flames.gif" width="100" height="38"></a></p>
<p><b>Season 1:</b>&nbsp; The Calgary Flames played just how everyone expected
them to in Season 1, and finished well out of the playoff picture.&nbsp;
However, they had some good performances from some of their young guys, which is
giving fans promise for the future.&nbsp; However, the Flames management wants
to ice a team that can compete in the CEHL now.&nbsp; In the end, all the
expectations for how the Flames would do in Season 1 played out accordingly and
fans were looking forward to the next season.</p>
<p><b>Offseason:</b>&nbsp; This offseason is one to remember for Flames
fans.&nbsp; After season 1, management assured its fans that they were dedicated
to bringing the Flames organization into the upper echelon of the league.&nbsp;
This offseason they made some giant steps in the right direction.&nbsp; To start
off, the Flames signed goalie Dwayne Roloson to be their starter for the next
couple of seasons.&nbsp; In turn, Roman Turek left town along with Rob Ray in
exchange for cash.&nbsp; Also, the Flames added a scoring touch in signing
Fredrick Modin, and a top notch defenseman when they signed Jason Smith away
from their rivals, the Edmonton Oilers.&nbsp; In turn, Dan Boyle became
expendable with all of the defensive potential Calgary has and he left
town.&nbsp; In the Boyle deal the Flames also lost Season 1 first half MVP Maxim
Afinagenov, but got back a great scoring touch in Mark Parrish and another young
defenseman in Martin Skoula.&nbsp; The Flames seem to be a team headed in the
right direction after some good moves made by GM JM Tremblay.</p>
<p><b>Youth to Watch:&nbsp;</b> The Flames youth centers around their
defense.&nbsp; This young corps has the potential to grow into the best defense
in the league.&nbsp; When Jason Smith was brought to town, it meant that there
would be some very good young defensemen sent down to the minors.&nbsp; With the
trade of Dan Boyle, one more spot has opened up on the pro roster, but another
good young defenseman was also added to the mix.&nbsp; There is not one name to
look out for on this team to breakthrough this season.&nbsp; Look out for a
couple of the following names to not only break the pro roster, but have a
successful season and career: Martin Skoula, Jordan Leopold, Toni Lydman, Robyn
Regehr, and Jay McKee.&nbsp; Up front they have some good youth also.&nbsp; The
top 2 lines are pretty well set, but look for Chuck Kobasew to get a chance on
the third line playing with, perhaps, Brad Isbister, and for Niklas Hagman to
get 4th line duties.</p>
<p><b>Expectations and Prediction:</b>&nbsp; The Flames expectations this year
are to simply improve on last year.&nbsp; They acquired a top defenseman from a
division rival, the Minnesota Wild who finished ahead of them lost many players
to free agency, and the Flames, as a team, look better coming into the
season.&nbsp; This looks like a good formula for improvement on last
season.&nbsp; The Flames still seem to be 2 maybe 3 seasons from a playoff
birth, but they have a ton of very young defensemen with enormous potential for
success.&nbsp; Their offense is good enough for them to compete with some good
teams, and Dwayne Roloson is an upgrade from Roman Turek.&nbsp; The Flames will
likely be in the playoff hunt right down to the wire, but don't expect them to
make it just yet.&nbsp; <b>3rd in Northwest.&nbsp; 9th in Western Conference.</b></p>
<p align="left"><a href="./cehlRosters.html#Carolina"><img src="hurricanes.gif" width="100" height="38"></a>
<b>Carolina Hurricanes&nbsp;</b></p>
<p align="left"><b>Season 1:</b>&nbsp; The first season for Carolina can be
summed up in one word...dreadful.&nbsp; The Hurricanes have some very skilled
players on their team, but they lack any depth whatsoever.&nbsp; They have a
good first line with nothing left to follow it, they have one all-star
defenseman, with nothing to support him, and their starting goalie has very
little experience and struggles.&nbsp; Management insists they are a club that
will build through the draft and tells their fans not to worry, because in 4 or
5 seasons they will be in the playoffs going for the cup.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Offseason:</b>&nbsp; The Canes hired a new GM, Richard
Painter this offseason.&nbsp; After his hiring, Painter landed Deadmarsh and
young for some experienced scoring, but lost Arnott and Weiss.&nbsp; The Canes
are now expected to be shopping around for a better starting goalie to take the
reigns from Brent Johnson.&nbsp; With a new GM, it is expected many changes will
be happening in Raleigh.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><b>Youth to Watch:</b>&nbsp; The Canes aren't expecting to go
much firther than they did last season, but they do want to at least get out of
the basement.&nbsp; If they are to achieve this they are going to need their
plethora of youth at forward to step up.&nbsp; After the first line, the Canes
offense is pretty thin.&nbsp; At center, expect Brian Sutherby to get a chance
to play on the third line with Jani Rita or Mike Zigomanis at left wing.&nbsp;
Steven Weiss has an opportunity to start on Carolina's 2nd line with two good
scorers in Curtis Brown and Danius Zubrus.&nbsp; Also, if things are not going
well for Carolina, expect to see them give Weiss a shot on the first line, and
perhaps move Sutherby to the 2nd line.&nbsp; If they are given this opportunity,
look out for Brian Sutherby and Steven Weiss to make names for themselves in
Season 2.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Expectations and Predictions:</b>&nbsp; The Carolina
Hurricanes are a one line team with a very weak defense and trouble in
net.&nbsp; They might just finish at the bottom of the barrel again, but will
have competition from the likes of Minnesota and Columbus.&nbsp; The Canes need
some of their youth to start stepping up before they think about moving much
closer to the playoffs.&nbsp; With the likes of Zigomanis, Rita, Sutherby,
Weiss, Tanabe, and Ward, the Canes look to have a bright future.&nbsp;
Management only wishes the future was now.&nbsp; <b>5th in Southeast.&nbsp; 15th
in Eastern Conference.</b>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><a href="./cehlRosters.html#Chicago"><img src="blackhawks.gif" width="100" height="38"></a><b>Chicago
Blackhawks&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></p>
<p align="left"><b>Season 1:</b>&nbsp; The Blackhawks had a very good Season 1,
making it to the playoffs with the 5th ranking in the Western Conference.&nbsp;
They had some very good play from their goalie Jocelyn Thibault, and had a
balanced offense and defense.&nbsp; In the playoffs they had the task of taking
on the Cinderalla story Nashville Predators in the first round.&nbsp; That
turned out to be one of the best and closest first round matches, and Chicago
took it at home in 6 games.&nbsp; In round two the Hawks took on the powerhouse
of the West, the Colorado Avalanche.&nbsp; The Hawks were heavy underdogs, and
for good reason.&nbsp; They were easily outmatched by the Avs on every level,
and were blown out in the series 4 games to 0.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Offseason:</b>&nbsp; The Blackhawks don't want to mess with
success, and so they basically are keeping the same team as they had in season
1.&nbsp; The only signing that they made was to improve their defense, which
management said was the key component they need to keep up with a team like
Colorado.&nbsp; In came Filip Kuba, one of the Minnesota castoffs, who will
likely be the teams top defenseman throughout the season.&nbsp; Chicago didn't
want to change to much, but the area they did address, they addressed very well,
and they should be as good or a better this season.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Youth to Watch:</b>&nbsp; The Hawks have their mind set on
going with the same team they did last season.&nbsp; However, young defenseman
Mike Commodore might be ready to step in.&nbsp; Nathan Dempsey is currently
Chicago's 6th defenseman, and Commodore should be given a chance to move into
that role.&nbsp; Expect to see Commodore play a few games for the Hawks this
season.&nbsp; If he does not squeeze into that role, he should at least be the
teams 7th defenseman in place of Sandy McCarthy, who really does not seem to fit
in with the team.&nbsp; Also Tyler Arnason should be playing on the pro team
this season.&nbsp; The Hawks are very thin at center and Arnason could fit in on
the 2nd or 3rd line.&nbsp; Expect to see him become a regular and put up some
good numbers for the Hawks.&nbsp; He might be Calder Trophy material.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Expectations and Predictions:</b>&nbsp; The Hawks should yet
again make the playoffs in the West.&nbsp; On paper their offense and defense
looks very thin, but in Season 1 they played very well together as a team, and
with only 1 addition, it should continue into Season 2.&nbsp; In net, Jocelyn
Thibault is one of the supreme young goalies in the league, and carried Chicago
most of the way last season.&nbsp; They will again rely on him to do much of the
work, if he falters, the team will most likely follow.&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>2nd in
Central.&nbsp; 7th in Western Conference.</b></p>
<p align="left"><a href="./cehlRosters.html#Colorado"><img src="avalanche.gif" width="100" height="38"></a><b>Colorado
Avalanche&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></p>
<p align="left"><b>Season 1:</b>&nbsp; The Colorado Avalanche simply dominated
the Western Conference in Season 1.&nbsp; The Avs were in 2nd place at the
halfway mark, but turned it on in the second half an ran away with the
conference title.&nbsp; In the playoffs they played their rivals the Detroit Red
Wings in round one, and ripped them to shreds in 5 games.&nbsp; In the second
round the Avalanche again had an easy go at it, when they played the Chicago
Blackhawks, and outplayed them in every way.&nbsp; They swept them aside in 4
easy games.&nbsp; In the Western Conference finals, The Avalanche were up
against the very defensive Vancouver Canucks.&nbsp; The Canucks put up a good
fight, but in the end the Avalanche were just too strong for any Western
Conference team as they knocked out Vancouver in 6 games.&nbsp; The Avalanche
then met the New Jersey Devils in the first ever Champions Cup Final.&nbsp;
After dominating the Western Conference and having New Jersey come out of a very
tough Eastern Conference, Colorado was favoured to win.&nbsp; But the Devils
crushed the Avalanche in 4 very surprising games, which made everyone wonder if
the East really was that much better than the West.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Offseason:</b>&nbsp; The Avalanche lost Greg DeVries, a solid
defenseive defenseman, and Georges Laraques, a young goon, to free agency, and
because of the cap could not sign anyone else.&nbsp; They also made a huge trade
that saw longtime captain, and fan favourite Joe Sakic sent off to Florida for
Erik Cole and Brad Boyes.&nbsp; The Avalanche have a good
mixture of young and old.&nbsp; They have 2 solid lines, with 4 solid defensemen
behind them.&nbsp; It is all backed up by young goalie Roberto Luongo, who
played solid in net for the Avalanche all through the playoffs, until he met
veteran Eddie Belfour in the finals.&nbsp; The Avs will take a hit with the loss
of one of the best players in the game, and it will be interesting to see how
they handle it.&nbsp; They should again be a challenge in the West, but have
taken a step back, while others have gone forward.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Youth to Watch:</b>&nbsp; The Avalanche have 3 solid right
wingers, and the position for the 4th liner will be fought over between 3
guys.&nbsp; Veteran Mike Keane, 27 year old rookie Brian Willsie, and young
prospect Igor Grigorenko.&nbsp; If he doesn't get the job at the beginning of
the season, expect Grigorenko to still see a little time on the 4th line, and
maybe even the third.&nbsp; With a team as strong as Colorado is, Grigorenko has
a chance to play with some dynamite linemates.&nbsp; It may be a good idea to
maybe even play him on the 1st or 2nd line with Sakic or Forsberg to ease him
in, that would also give the Avs more depth on the 3rd and 4th line.&nbsp; Look
out for Grigorenko.&nbsp; If he gets the job he will be after the Calder Trophy,
and should be considered a favourite to win it, if he plays with Sakic or
Forsberg.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Expectations and Prediction:</b>&nbsp; The Avalanche made
some moves in the offseason that will shake them up a little.&nbsp; They still
have a solid team, but just with a new look.&nbsp; The Avs will take a hit with
the loss of one of the best players in the game, and it will be interesting to
see how they handle it.&nbsp; They should again be a challenge in the West, but
have taken a step back, while others have gone forward.&nbsp; <b>1st in
Northwest.&nbsp; 2nd in Western Conference.</b></p>
<p align="left"><a href="./cehlRosters.html#Columbus"><img src="jackets.gif" width="100" height="38"></a><b>Columbus
Blue Jackets&nbsp;</b></p>
<p align="left"><b>Season 1:</b>&nbsp; Season 1 saw the Columbus Blue Jackets
maintain their plentiful talent of youth, and finish near the bottom of the
standings.&nbsp; One significant move saw the Blue Jackets' goal scorer Ray
Whitney shipped off to Vancouver in exchange for the Sedin twins.&nbsp; Columbus
was not expected to finish with a very good record, and they did exactly what
was expected from them in the first season.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Offseason:</b>&nbsp; The story of this years free agency was
when the Columbus Blue Jackets let RFA Olli Jokinen walk to Ottawa after he
signed an offer sheet with them worth 4.25 million for 5 years.&nbsp; For
compensation the Jackets got Ottawa's next 3 first round picks, starting in
2004.&nbsp; Fans were quite upset management did not match the offer to their
emerging scorer, as the teams pro payroll is slightly over 23 million dollars
this season, second lowest to only Minnesota.&nbsp; The Jackets added some
defensive help in acquiring Stanislav Neckar, and with Marc Denis in their net,
they felt no need to keep top goalie prospect Jason Bacashihua around, so he was
shipped to LA, for Vancouvers 1st round pick.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Youth to Watch:</b>&nbsp; Rostislav Klesla will be the number
1 defenseman this year on the Columbus blueline.&nbsp; This blue chip prospect
should have a breakthrough year this season, and start to form into one of the
leagues dominant defensive defensemen.&nbsp; He will likely be on the first
pairing alongside either Ruslan Salei or Bryan Allen, which will make for a
tough duo either way.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Expectations and Prediction:</b>&nbsp; Lets just say the New
York Islanders are hanging onto Columbus' first round pick tightly.&nbsp; The
Jackets had low expectations in Season 1, and in Season 2 they are even
lower.&nbsp; Most say Columbus will finish in last place.&nbsp; The Jackets do
have the potential to surprise some people if Marc Denis can hold the fort, and
the Sedin twins can start to put up the numbers scouts thought they could when
they were drafted.&nbsp; However, all of these happening in one season is
unlikely, and Columbus should finish in, or on the steps of the basement.&nbsp; <b>5th
in Central.&nbsp; 14th in Western Conference.</b>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><a href="./cehlRosters.html#Dallas"><img src="stars.gif" width="100" height="38"></a><b>Dallas
Stars&nbsp;</b></p>
<p align="left"><b>Season 1:</b>&nbsp; At the beginning of Season 1 the Dallas
Stars were one of the big payroll teams to struggle.&nbsp; They eventually
started to play better, but still finished with only the 6th ranking in the weak
Western Conference, far below expectations.&nbsp; Once they made it to the
second season, they met the very defensive Vancouver Canucks, and hot goalie Dan
Cloutier.&nbsp; They won the first game of the series very convincingly, and it
looked as though Dallas was starting to play how they should.&nbsp; However,
Vancouver answered back with four straight wins to take the series in 5, and
Dallas was sent home far earlier than anyone had thought.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Offseason:</b>&nbsp; The Stars were very near the 50 million
dollar salary cap, and had to make some moves to get below it.&nbsp; The Stars
made 2 moves that will change the team significantly heading into Season
2.&nbsp; The first saw them ship off sniper Martin Straka to the Islanders in
exchange for Tim Connolly and 2 draft picks.&nbsp; The second saw them ship off
defenseman Richard Matvichuk and 2 prospects to Toronto in exchange for prospect
Alexei Smirnov.&nbsp; These moves make the Stars weaker on offense and defense
to start the year, but the 2 players they got in return signals a minor youth
movement in Dallas.&nbsp; This suggests that perhaps if the team fails again
this Season, a full youth movement might swing in.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Youth to Watch:</b>&nbsp; The Stars are very thin up front
and will be forced to use a couple of younger guys this Season.&nbsp; At center,
expect to see newly acquired Alexei Smirnov step in to play on either the 3rd or
4th line.&nbsp; He is the strongest, fasting skating, and the has the best
scoring touch out of all the other centers on the farm.&nbsp; Also, the Stars
are very thin ate left wing.&nbsp; Expect to see Barret Heisten, Mathias
Tjarnqvist, and defensive forward Steve Gainey to fight for the final two spots
on the pro team.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><b>Expectations and Prediction:</b>&nbsp; The Stars are too thin
at forward to make a run for the cup.&nbsp; They have two very solid lines that
could rival the top two lines of any other CEHL club, but after that it is
significantly weakened.&nbsp; Their defense is one of the more offensive in the
league, and are not considered a physical threat at all.&nbsp; Marty Turco will
be relied upon to carry the load, and will have added pressure after signing a 3
year deal where he will make 4.3 million dollars annually.&nbsp; The Stars
should be a playoff team, but will likely be knocked out in the first, or
perhaps, second round.&nbsp; <b>2nd in Pacific.&nbsp; 5th in Western Conference.</b></p>
<p align="left"><a href="./cehlRosters.html#Detroit"><img src="wings.gif" width="100" height="38"></a><b>Detroit
Red Wings&nbsp;</b></p>
<p align="left"><b>Season 1:</b>&nbsp; Right off the bat management in Detroit
was forced to trade a slew of big name players to get below the 60 million
dollar luxury tax cap.&nbsp; They were able to ship out names such as Shanahan,
Fedorov and Hull, and the return they got disappointed fans.&nbsp; Nonetheless,
the Red Wings still had enough firepower to slip into the playoffs by 1 point
over the Phoenix Coyotes.&nbsp; In the first round they met the very powerful
Colorado Avalanche.&nbsp; Many expected it to be a quick sweep, but the Red
Wings were able to win 1 out of 5 games before being eliminated.&nbsp; GM Mike
Clark put some surprising unknown names into the lineup for the playoffs and had
some very good play from them.&nbsp; Defenseman Tyler Cook and forward Boris
Protsenko put up good numbers for playing against one of the leagues
powerhouses, and fans were looking forward to seeing them play this year.&nbsp;
However, it was learned that Commisioner Ryan Williams has banned Protsenko from
the league, leaving many fans disgruntled, and Clark later traded Cook to the
Panthers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><b>Offseason:</b>&nbsp; The Red Wings made some very big moves
this offseason, to hopefully improve their team.&nbsp; The first, and most
surprising was when they inked Dan Cloutier to a 3 year deal worth 13.5 million
dollars.&nbsp; This started a long controversy in Hockeytown between GM Mike
Clark and goaltender Curtis Joseph.&nbsp; The two got in a war of words when
Clark started it off by saying, during a press conference, that he wanted
&quot;the old bum out of town.&quot;&nbsp; Curtis replied with insults against
Clark's new pizza joint, BC World Pizza, in which Toronto GM Rory Boylen is a
partner.&nbsp; In turn, Clark dealt Joseph off to Pittsburgh along with two
prospects in exchange for Steve Ruuchin, Phillipe Boucher, and Igor Kravchuk.&nbsp;
A few days later, Detroit shipped off high paid defenseman Niklas Lidstrom to
Florida along with Brad Boyes, Alex Auld, and playoff star Ty Cook, in exchange
for Brendan Shanahan, Sandis Ozolinsh and Chris Mason.&nbsp; Overall, the Wings
have got stronger on forward, defense, and now have last years Vezina winner in
Cloutier.&nbsp; The Wings are expected to return to the playoffs this year, and
have a little more success.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Youth to Watch:</b>&nbsp; The Red Wings have a lot of young
guys ready to enter the prime of their careers.&nbsp; Patrick Stefan is one
player that Red Wing fans are eager to see develop into the scorer that scouts
thought he would be. He will have added pressure to put up good numbers, as he
is in the last year of his current contract, and will be looking for lots of
cash.&nbsp; Stefan will likely start the season on the third line alongside Jeff
Halpern and another young guy to look out for, Radim Vrbata.&nbsp; Vrbata did
not fit into Colorado's plans last season, and was traded to Detroit.&nbsp; He
had a decent season for the Wings, but with a better team around him Vrbata is
expected to put up much better numbers this time around.&nbsp; Vrbata and Stefan
should both be watched closely, and they have the chance to play on the same
line together, a duo that could be a powerful mainstay in Detroit for a long
time.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Expectations and Prediction:</b>&nbsp; The Red Wings seem to
have got stronger over the offseason.&nbsp; They finished 8th last year, and
so their goal is to finish in 5th or 6th this season.&nbsp; They are definitely
capable of competing with some of the other Western Conference teams, but lack
of team chemistry is their drawback.&nbsp;
Management and fans were looking forward to seeing Boris Protsenko return this
season, after some inspirational play in the playoffs last season.&nbsp;
However, Commisioner Ryan Williams has banned Protsenko from the league for
unknown reasons.&nbsp; Rumour has it that Protsenko had a rendezvous with
Williams' wife at their summer residence in Minden, while Ryan was staring at
school girls while sitting on the famous park bench in Sunderland.&nbsp; GM's
through the league are calling for Protsenko's return.&nbsp; Their argument is
that if everyone got banned from the league for sleeping with Williams' wife,
the CEHL wouldn't exist.&nbsp; Whatever happens, it seems there will be some bad
blood between Detroit and Vancouver this season for many reasons.&nbsp;
Hopefully this matter will blow over before the season starts up.&nbsp; <b>4th

<p align="left"><a href="./cehlRosters.html#Edmonton"><img src="oilers.gif" width="100" height="38"></a><b>Edmonton
Oilers&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></p>
<p align="left"><b>Season 1:</b>&nbsp; In season 1 the Oilers were projected to
be a playoff team.&nbsp; Coming down the stretch, Edmonton was in control of
their own destiny.&nbsp; Unfortunately for the Oilers, it was their destiny to
completely break down and miss the playoffs.&nbsp; In the end the Oilers missed
the playoffs by only 4 points, but they could have easily made it.&nbsp; The
Oilers were in the drivers seat coming down the final stretch, but they went on
to lose their last 9 games of the season.&nbsp; Edmonton could have finished the
season 2-7 and still made the playoffs, but they hit a major slump at the worst
time possible.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Offseason:</b>&nbsp; Only 1 day after Edmonton was officially
knocked out of the playoffs, GM Matt Bull held a news conference to announce
plans for the next season.&nbsp; He announced that Edmonton would allow most of
their free agents to walk, and they would have a minor rebuilding phase, one in
which they would remain competetive, and take another run at the post
season.&nbsp; Gone are Anson Carter, Todd Marchant, Jason Smith, Ryan Smith and
Glen Wesley.&nbsp; The Oilers did make one significant UFA signing when they
brought in Cory Cross to help their blueline.&nbsp; Overall, the Oilers lost a
ton of talent over a matter of weeks.&nbsp; However, their defensemen are huge
and could pose a problem for other teams, but their forwards do not compare to
any of the elite teams.&nbsp; Expect Edmonton to again be a fringe playoff team,
they will be in another playoff race to the end where 1 or 2 wins could
determine their season 2 destiny.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Youth to Watch:</b>&nbsp; With the departure of most of their
lead role players, the Edmonton Oilers are expecting some of their young talent
to take over the team.&nbsp; On forward look out for Ales Hemsky and Jarret
Stoll.&nbsp; Hemsky will likely have the opportunity to play on the teams 3rd
line with Marty Reasoner and Jason Chimera.&nbsp; Hemsky has quick moves that
can trick the best defensemen, and is lethal when he shoots.&nbsp; He doesn't
have line mates that will help him score, so it will be up to Hemsky to get this
lines offense going.&nbsp; Stoll will likely play on the fourth line.&nbsp; It
is not known who will start on this line yet, but it will be one of the worst
4th lines in the league.&nbsp; Stoll should be watched closely however, and if
they get going, it will likely be because of his fiery play.&nbsp; On defense,
big Alexei Semenov is the one to watch.&nbsp; He will most likely start on the
second pairing with Cory Cross.&nbsp; Semenov is a big defenseman who, when he
throws his body around, is very tough to beat.&nbsp; He needs to learn to use
his body more than he currently does.&nbsp; With help from other big boys Rob
Blake, Cory Cross, and Eric Brewer, Semenov should be a big hitter in no time.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Expectations and Predictions:</b>&nbsp; It was a little
surprising when the Oilers went the rebuilding route, although as a small market
team they had little choice.&nbsp; They do have some good youth to start it off
with, and with experience from Rob Blake, and Jeff Hackett, it was a good time
to choose to rebuild.&nbsp; The Oilers should remain competitive though, and
should be in the playoff race yet again.&nbsp; If they can finish off better
than they did last year and avoid those hideous streaks, they have a decent shot
to be in the playoffs.&nbsp; <b>4th in Northwest.&nbsp; 10th in Western

<p align="left"><a href="./cehlRosters.html#Florida"><img src="panthers.gif" width="100" height="38"></a><b>Florida
Panthers&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></p>
<p align="left"><b>Season 1:</b>&nbsp; The Panthers best move all season was to
sign GM Shawn Fummerton.&nbsp; Fummerton changed this team from a rebuilding one
into a Champions Cup challenger overnight.&nbsp; Florida was in a race for top
spot in the East all season long, but fell short behind their division rival
Washington Capitals, and settled for 2nd.&nbsp; There they met the tough
Montreal Canadiens in the first round.&nbsp; The Canadiens put up a fight, and
at times they tore the Panthers to shreds, beating them 7-2 in one game.&nbsp;
But Florida had too much talent for Montreal, and won the series in 6
games.&nbsp; In round 2 the Panthers were up against the New Jersey
Devils.&nbsp; New Jersey out hit and outplayed Florida with their depth.&nbsp;
Florida was one of, if not the most skilled team in the league, but a team with
as much depth and experience as New Jersey could knock them off.&nbsp; After
being considered a cup favourite at the beginning of the Season, Florida was
disappointingly knocked out in 6 games by the Devils.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Offseason:</b>&nbsp; The Panthers lost a huge part of their
team this offseason, when Patrick Roy decided to call it a career.&nbsp; As a
result, the Panthers were left without a goalie, after backup Jani Hurme left to
LA.&nbsp; The Panthers were forced to trade for a goalie, and they got him from
Pittsburgh.&nbsp; Florida landed Johan Hedberg after he became expendable
when the Penguins got Curtis Joseph.&nbsp; They lost Bates Battaglia in the
deal, which will hurt their forwards a little.&nbsp; A few days later the
Panthers got a backup goalie in Trevor Kidd and forward Andreas Dackell for
defenseman Sean Hill.&nbsp; Florida also made some deals to bring in 2 franchise
players. First they landed Niklas Lidstrom and a
slew of young prospects from Detroit for Brendan Shanahan, Sandis Ozolinsh and
Chris Mason, and second they got Joe Sakic for Erik Cole and Brad Boyes.&nbsp; This offseason saw the face of the Panthers change quite a
bit, and only time will tell if they hurt or improved the team.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Youth to Watch:</b>&nbsp; Tyler Cook is the one to
watch.&nbsp; He played solid defensively for Detroit last year, in a series that
was lopsided.&nbsp; He is now on a stronger team that will help him out more,
and could have a breakthrough season.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Expectations and Prediction:</b>&nbsp; The Panthers are still
a decent team, but no where near what they were last season.&nbsp; They have
made some questionable moves in the offseason, and are left with holes
everywhere.&nbsp; They again have some good talent, but they lack depth.&nbsp;
The team has a very weak 3rd and 4th line, but the first line is dynamite, and much like last season, Niklas
Lidstrom will have to carry his defensemen, although this crew is good
defensively and much better off than Lidstom's Wings were last season.&nbsp; In
net, Hedberg will have big shoes to fill, and will likely not put up the numbers
Roy did.&nbsp; The Panthers should still be a playoff team, but they are a far
cry from the contenders they were in Season 1.&nbsp; <b>3rd in Southeast.&nbsp;

<p align="left"><a href="./cehlRosters.html#LosAngeles"><img src="kings.gif" width="100" height="38"></a><b>Los
Angelas Kings&nbsp;</b></p>
<p align="left"><b>Season 1:</b>&nbsp; The Kings had a very poor season 1.&nbsp;
At the half way mark they were the worst team in the league, and improved only a
little in the second half.&nbsp; As a result the Kings traded away some big name
players such as Ziggy Palffy, Aaron Miller, and Jason Allison before seasons
end.&nbsp; With the talent that team had, fans hoped for a successful season,
but LA was far from a playoff appearance.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><b>Offseason:</b>&nbsp; The first move made was to hire a new
GM.&nbsp; Trent Allen was hired on to take this team out of the gutter.&nbsp;
Right away he made some deals and signings to improve the team.&nbsp; From the
Free Agent market, in came Jonas Hoglund, Luke Richardson, Richard Smehlik,
Jamie Pushor, and Jani Hurme who they later dealt.&nbsp; Goalie Felix Potvin was
lost to free agency, and so Allen went on a goalie search.&nbsp; He landed Sean
Burke in a trade with the Atlanta Thrashers, and sent Camalleri, Belanger and
Rullier packing.&nbsp; In another move, the Kings surprisingly sent all-star
Mats Sundin to the Islanders for Mika Noronen, Scottie Upshall, and Steve
Eminger, significantly improving the team in the long run.&nbsp; Rod Brind'amour
and Ville Nieminen were brought in to add depth to the team, and Chris Chelios
was traded for to lead the teams defense alongside longtime pal Brian Leetch.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Youth to Watch:</b>&nbsp; LA's 4th line is one to watch
closely.&nbsp; It has the potential to be Kiel Macleod, Ville Niemenen, and
Scottie Upshall.&nbsp; This would be a line that has the potential to grow
together and be around for a very long time.&nbsp; If they do not produce this
year there are others to watch.&nbsp; Stanislav Chistov will likely be on LA's
2nd line with Hoglund and Rasmussen.&nbsp; Chistov is just waiting to have a
breakout season, and with expectation low on this team, he will have no
pressure, and will be free to do whatever he wants.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Expectations and Prediction:</b>&nbsp; LA has improved their
defense significantly this season, and that is what has to hold for them to be
successful.&nbsp; Backing them up is one of the best goalies in the league, Sean
Burke.&nbsp; Up front they are very thin and should not be counted on to produce
much offense.&nbsp; The Kings will likely be a trap team and play a slow,
defensive, and boring style of hockey.&nbsp; However, their defense looks strong
enough to get them some wins.&nbsp; They will likely miss the playoffs again,
but if the defense plays well enough, and Burke can hold the fort, they may make
a surprise run into the playoffs.&nbsp; <b>5th in Pacific.&nbsp; 13th in Western

<p align="left"><a href="./cehlRosters.html#Minnesota"><img src="wild.gif" width="100" height="38"></a><b>Minnesota
Wild&nbsp;</b></p>

<p align="left"><b>Season 1:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Minnesota had a very surprising and
pleasant first season.&nbsp; The Wild were led by stars such as Marion Gaborik,
Cliff Ronning and solid goaltending from Manny Fernendez, and players like these
nearly led the Wild to a playoff berth.&nbsp; Fans were pleased to watch their
team fight to the bitter and and miss the post season by single digits.&nbsp;
Down the stretch, the Wild played just as well as they did throughout the
season, but that kind of play was just not good enough despite the weakening
play of Phoenix, and Edmonton.&nbsp; They were ultimately beat out by the
Detroit Red Wings who won their last 3 games.</p>

<p align="left"><b>Offseason:</b>&nbsp; After a close brush at the playoffs in
season 1, fans were very angry to see GM Josh Scott let all of the teams free
agents sign with other CEHL clubs.&nbsp; Cliff Ronning, Filip Kuba, Manny
Fernendez and Dwayne Roloson all left town for greener pastures.&nbsp; Now that
the team had lost two potential number 1 goalies, they had to sign
someone.&nbsp; Scott decided to move on the cast off, Byron Dafoe.&nbsp; Dafoe
signed for a mere 2 million per season, after many teams turned their back on
him, despite putting up good numbers before being traded away from
Atlanta.&nbsp; Also, defenseman Kimo Timonen signed a deal with Minnesota that
makes him the highest paid player on the team at 3 million per season.&nbsp; All
in all though, the Wild lost way to many players in the offseason, and come out
of it a much worse team.</p>

<p align="left"><b>Youth to Watch:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Pierre-Marc Bouchard is the
young guy to look out for in season two on Minnesota.&nbsp; It looks as though
Bouchard will either play center on the 3rd or 4th line, or be moved to right
wing to play on the second line.&nbsp; Bouchard was expected to have a great
rookie campaign, but it ended up being a nightmare.&nbsp; He was among the
lowest scorers on the team, and was never able to get any momentum going.&nbsp;
Going into season 2 his confidence s not where the team would like it to
be.&nbsp; However, they are giving him a bigger role to play and this may
inspire him to have his breakthrough year.</p>

<p align="left"><b>Expectations and Prediction:</b>&nbsp; With heavy losses from
free agency, the Minnesota Wild should actually be expected to take a step back
from last season.&nbsp; Byron Dafoe played well in Atlanta, but after being
shipped off to Phoenix his play declined rapidly.&nbsp; Dafoe is no replacement
for Fernendez, or even last seasons back-up Dwayne Roloson.&nbsp; Up fron they
lack leadership and experience to go very far.&nbsp; Their first line is
mediocre while their defense is extremely weak beyond Kimmo Timonen.&nbsp; Look
for the Wild to climb down the ladder of success and find a corner in or near
the basement do hide their shame in.&nbsp; <b>5th in Northwest.&nbsp; 15th in
Western Conference.</b></p>

<p align="left"><a href="./cehlRosters.html#Montreal"><img src="canadiens.gif" width="100" height="38"></a><b>Montreal
Canadiens&nbsp;</b></p>

<p align="left"><b>Season 1:</b>&nbsp; Montreal had a very impressive season
1.&nbsp; After adding young goal scoring sensation Ilya Kovalchuk, Montreal fans
became very excited about the teams present and future.&nbsp; Montreal was a
grinding team all season long and had some very hard fought wins.&nbsp; They
were able to qualify 7th in the very difficult Eastern Conference, where they
met the Florida Panthers in the first round.&nbsp; There, Montreal jumped up 1-0
in the series with a very surprising 7-2 win in game 1.&nbsp; However, Florida
was just too talented and experienced for Montreal's younger team.&nbsp; The
Canadiens just opened that eyes of the Panthers.&nbsp; Florida went on to win 4
of the next 5 games, and took the series in 6.&nbsp; Montreal wore Florida right
out though with their very gritty style of play.&nbsp; Some attribute Florida's
second round exit to the tough play they had in round one against Montreal.</p>

<p align="left"><b>Offseason:&nbsp; </b>The Canadiens lost Voktor Kozlov to free
agency after he had a disappointing season with the team after they traded for
him.&nbsp; But the Canadiens replaced him...and then some.&nbsp; Their first
signing occurred when they inked Anson Carter to a deal that included a huge
signing bonus.&nbsp; Carter brings an added scoring touch to Montreal, and will
definitely improve the team immensely at forward.&nbsp; Also added were forwards
Alexander Daigle and Trent Klatt.&nbsp; Klatt will fit in perfectly with the
gritty style of play in Montreal.&nbsp; Daigle is a little bit of a
surprise.&nbsp; Montreal took a chance with him, and inked him to a contract
that will likely start him off on the farm.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, Daigle has a
natural scoring touch, and if he is put with the right players, he could put up
some very solid numbers.&nbsp; Daigle is a wild card, keep and eye on him this
season.</p>

<p align="left"><b>Youth to Watch:</b>&nbsp; Marcel Hossa will likely play on
the teams second line with Bulis and Zednik.&nbsp; Hossa is lethal in the
offensive zone, just like his older brother.&nbsp; He will have good linemates
with him in season 2.&nbsp; Hossa should have a season to remember, and with his
likely emergence as a star, Montreal's second line will begin to form into one
of the most difficult to handle in the league.</p>

<p align="left"><b>Expectations and Prediction:</b>&nbsp; Montreal has much
higher expectations this season.&nbsp; They are one of the Eastern Conference
teams that has improved greatly in the offseason.&nbsp; Montreal added more
scoring and grit, which are two very important ingredients for success in the
East.&nbsp; The Canadiens are slowly becoming one of the elite teams in the
league.&nbsp; The right moves are being made which is sending the team up in the
league.&nbsp; The Candiens are no longer pretenders, they are legitimate
contenders.&nbsp; <b>4th in Northeast.&nbsp; 8th in Eastern Conference.</b></p>

<p align="left"><a href="./cehlRosters.html#Nashville"><img src="predators.gif" width="100" height="38"></a><b>Nashville
Predators&nbsp;</b></p>

<p align="left"><b>Season 1:</b>&nbsp; Nashville was by far the most surprising
story of season 1.&nbsp; The Predators added experienced goalie Mike Richter,
and sniper Jeff O'neill to their lineup early in season one, and these two made
a big difference.&nbsp; Nashville was not expected to be anywhere near the
playoffs in season 1, but not only did they make the playoffs, but they earned
home ice advantage in the first round.&nbsp; Once there they met the 5th place
Chicago Blackhawks.&nbsp; This was one of the more even first round matchups.&nbsp;
The Predators played very well for a first time playoff team, but in the end,
minor mistakes killed them.&nbsp; The Predators fought all season long for a
chance at the cup, but were knocked out by the Hawks in round 1, 4 games to 2.</p>

<p align="left"><b>Offseason:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Predators added some defensive
depth this offseason with the addition of free agent Andrei Zyuzin, and a trade
that sent Bill Houlder to Toronto for Aki Berg and Jyrki Lumme.&nbsp; Also, the
Predators added Jason Weimer who will start on either the 2nd or 3rd line this
season.&nbsp; Nashville did not lose anyone that will affect their team in a
negative way in the offseason, and come into season 2 improved over last years
team.</p>

<p align="left"><b>Youth to Watch:</b>&nbsp; It was a little bit of a suprise
that Nashville added Zyuzin to their team with young defensemen Dan Hamhuis and
Kyle Rossiter coming up.&nbsp; Rossiter seems physically ready for CEHL
competition and should be given a chance to prove himself this season.&nbsp;
Hamhuis should also see some time in the pros.&nbsp; He doesn't seem quite as
ready to step in as Rossiter is, but look for these guys to be given a chance,
and look for Rossiter to make a very good impression.</p>

<p align="left"><b>Expectations and Prediction:</b>&nbsp; It will be hard for
Nashville to repeat what the accomplished in season 1.&nbsp; Again the Predators
look weak on paper, but don't count them out at all.&nbsp; Expect Tomas Vokoun
to take over the starting role from aging Mike Richter.&nbsp; the question is if
this young guy can continue their success.&nbsp; At the first sign of failure
expect to see Richter back between the pipes.&nbsp; It is simple, no one knows
what to expect from this team. On paper they are not anything special, but they
weren't last year either.&nbsp; Expect the Preds to still be a playoff team and
learn from last year, but home advantage for a second straight season is
unlikely.&nbsp; <b>3rd in Central.&nbsp; 8th in Western Conference.</b></p>

<p align="left"><a href="./cehlRosters.html#NewJersey"><img src="devils.gif" width="100" height="38"></a><b>New
Jersey Devils&nbsp;</b></p>

<p align="left"><b>Season 1:</b>&nbsp; Season 1 started out very rough for the
Devils, as they were out of the playoff picture for about a quarter of the
season.&nbsp; However, they were able to turn it around and finish it the best
way possible.&nbsp; They came on strong in the second half, and were among the
leagues best offensively, defensively, and in net.&nbsp; They powered their way
to finish third in the East, and taking a run at Florida and Washington.&nbsp;
In the first round they met Pittsburgh's high octane offense.&nbsp; At times New
Jersey seemed outplayed, and the series went back and forth, offense one game,
defense the next.&nbsp; In the end, New Jersey was able to equal the offensive
level of Pittsburgh, and knocked them out in 6.&nbsp; The second round saw them
play Florida.&nbsp; The Devils were able to outplay the Panthers in every aspect
of the game, and the 2 games they did lose, were very close.&nbsp; New Jersey
ended the Panthers' season much earlier than expected in 6 games.&nbsp; The
Eastern Conference final saw the Devils against the upstart Bruins.&nbsp; Two
very defensive teams matched off very well.&nbsp; The Bruins had made a name for
themselves thanks to their heavy hitting system.&nbsp; New Jersey recognized
this and adapte very well, and knocked the Bruins off in 6 as well.&nbsp; It was
off to the Challenge Cup finals for the Devils where they were to meet the
Colorado Avalanche.&nbsp; The Avalanche came in as heavy favourites, since they
cut through the Western Conference with extreme ease.&nbsp; The Devils saw this
to their advantage and played a &quot;take no prisoners&quot; style of
game.&nbsp; Not only did the Devils upset Colorado, but they swept them in 4
easy games.&nbsp; The New Jersey Devils became the first ever Challenge Cup
Champions, and Keith Primeau was awarded the Conn Smythe Trophy.&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left"><b>Offseason:</b>&nbsp; After a great season, the realization
hit Devils management that they needed to cut salary to get under the cap.&nbsp;
As a result, Scott Neidermayer was lost to free agency, despite the teams best
efforts to keep him in town.&nbsp; The loss of one defenseman led to the signing
of a cheaper one.&nbsp; Ken Klee was brought into town to play on the second
pairing.&nbsp; Klee is likely not going to improve on or equal the play of
Neidermayer, but bringing him in keeps the Devils defense at a firm
balance.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p align="left"><b>Youth to Watch:</b>&nbsp; The Devils are a team built on
experience and toughness.&nbsp; They do not have any youth that will step into
the pro lineup full time this year.&nbsp; In the future look out for Adrian
Foster, Stephen Guolla, and Barry Tallackson to begin to develop, and perhaps
even get some time this year.</p>

<p align="left"><b>Expectations and Prediction:</b>&nbsp; After winning the cup
in Season 1, expectations for this team couldn't be higher.&nbsp; They took a
huge blow by losing Scott Niedermayer to free agency however, but the rest of
the championship team is around.&nbsp; They have a solid nucleus that makes up
one of the deepest team skill wise in the league.&nbsp; The Devils should be
back this year and will contend to go all the way yet again.&nbsp; <b>2nd in
Atlantic.&nbsp; 6th in Eastern Conference.</b></p>

York Islanders&nbsp;</b></p>

<p align="left"><b>Season 1:</b>&nbsp; The Islanders traded away a ton of talent
at the beginning of season 1, and it looked like they were going to
rebuild.&nbsp; They were at or near the bottom of the Eastern Conference all
season long.&nbsp; At times they looked better, but they turned from competitors
to the laughing stock of the league.&nbsp; Fans were frustrated with the huge
step backwards they took, and it showed in ticket sales.</p>

<p align="left"><b>Offseason:</b>&nbsp; The Islanders were very busy in the
offseason, and promised fans that they would be a playoff team in season
2.&nbsp; They brought in Josef Stumpel, Trevor Linden, Felix Potvin and Mike
Johnson via free agency, and then traded for Owen Nolan, Mats Sundin, Wade
Redden, and Ruslan Salei.&nbsp; The team strengthened themselves in everyway,
and GM Keith Johnson is now loved by Islanders fans.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left"><b>Youth to Watch:</b>&nbsp; Justin Mapletoft should be watched
closely by fans.&nbsp; He will likely start on the teams 4th line with another
youngster Duncan Milroy, and center Petr Taticek.&nbsp; Mapletoft won't shoot
out the lights just yet with those linemates, but he should begin to mold into
the scorer Islanders management expect him to be.&nbsp; Look out for him to put
up around 40 points this season.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left"><b>Expectations and Prediction:</b>&nbsp; The Islanders have
improved a lot this offseason.&nbsp; They promised fans that they would be a
playoff team, and so that is what is now expected of them.&nbsp; They have 2
very good lines, and should be stable offensively.&nbsp; Their strength however
is on defense.&nbsp; They have 6 solid defensemen on the blueline that will make
it tough for any team to score.&nbsp; In net, Felix Potvin will try to revive
his career after a subpar season 1 in Los Angelas, and with the defense he has
in front of him, it would be very disappointing if he struggled.&nbsp; <b>3rd in
Atlantic.&nbsp; 9th in Eastern Conference.</b>&nbsp;</p>

York Rangers&nbsp;</b></p>

<p align="left"><b>Season 1:</b>&nbsp; With one of the leagues highest payrolls,
the New York Rangers struggled in season 1.&nbsp; At the beginning most expected
the Rangers to take a serious playoff run, and be a tough first round matchup.&nbsp;
However, their lack of depth on defense and forward was the key to their
downfall.&nbsp; They finished very close to the basement in the Eastern
Conference, and fans became very unhappy down the stretch.&nbsp; Ticket sales
plummeted, support for the team was at an all time low, and many wanted GM
Stephane Dore fired.&nbsp; Sure enough near the end of this pre season Dore was
let go and in came rookie GM Ed Swan to try and turn things around.</p>

<p align="left"><b>Offseason:</b>&nbsp; &nbsp;The Rangers made a questionable
move in the offseason by signing Brian Marchment, while they were already over
the cap.&nbsp; Marchment would be lost to a bidding war only days after
signing.&nbsp; This would be the final straw in Stephane Dore's reign over the
Rangers team.&nbsp; Rookie GM Ed Swan was hired and immediately made some
changes, although surprisingly these moves do not significantly change this
team.&nbsp; Key players traded away were Dan Blackburn, and prospects Jamie
Lundmark, and Patrick Sjostrom.&nbsp; Key acquisitions are Brian Smolinski, and
goalie prospect Mika Noronen.&nbsp; Overall the Rangers really did not do too
much to change the face of the team this offseason, but many prospects were
moved which will change them down the road.</p>

<p align="left"><b>Youth to Watch:</b>&nbsp; Mika Noronen should be watched
closely by fans of the Rangers.&nbsp; GM Ed Swan traded for him after trading
away Dan Blackburn and it was all planned ahead.&nbsp; The Rangers management
likes the young Noronen, and he should get a chance to take the starter role
from Mike Dunham.&nbsp; The Rangers will start off by planning to play Noronen
in about 20-30 games this season, but if Dunham starts to slack, or gets
injured, that could quickly change and the Rangers goalie of the future could
start now.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left"><b>Expectations and Prediction:</b>&nbsp; The Rangers have not
yet improved on their depth at forward or defense.&nbsp; The teams goaltending
is still a question mark, and with the season just starting Ed Swan has many
holes to fill if the fans don't call for his head.&nbsp; It is rumoured that
stars Pavel Bure and Eric Lindros are on the block, and if they are shopped
around correctly the Rangers could add some immediate depth to the club.&nbsp;
It would be hard to see them make the playoffs in season 2, but with this team
you just never know what to expect.&nbsp; <b>5th in Atlantic.&nbsp; 14th in
Eastern Conference.</b></p>

<p align="left"><a href="./cehlRosters.html#Ottawa"><img src="senators.gif" width="100" height="38"></a><b>Ottawa
Senators&nbsp;</b></p>

<p align="left"><b>Season 1:</b>&nbsp; The Senators never played up to their
potential in season 1.&nbsp; Right from the beginning of the season Ottawa was
sitting on the edge of the playoff picture.&nbsp; At times they showed signs of
brilliance, which is what fans were expecting the team to bring to the
table.&nbsp; But for most of the season they were sub par.&nbsp; Lack of
leadership may have been the key.&nbsp; Adam Oates was brought in to try and
change that around, but 1 guy couldn't make enough difference.&nbsp; Play from
key players, and surprise players was never consistent.&nbsp; The Senators tied
Atlanta for 8th in the East, but because of the tie breaker, Atlanta got in, and
Ottawa hit the golf course much earlier than expected.&nbsp; As a result GM Josh
Flynn was let go after season 1.&nbsp; Fans hope that new management can get
this team back on track, and back into the playoffs.&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left"><b>Offseason:</b>&nbsp; The Senators made a GM change right off
the bat.&nbsp; Out went Josh Flynn and in came offensive minded Jeff
Riddle.&nbsp; Right away Riddle told fans how he was going to construct an
offensive weapon in Ottawa.&nbsp; The first move was a sketchy one in which he
signed RFA Olli Jokinen away from Columbus, in which he gave up 3 first rounders
for him.&nbsp; Then came some big trades.&nbsp; Out went Zdeno Chara, Todd
White, Wade Redden, Rod Brind'Amour.&nbsp; In came Paul Kariya, Ron Francis, and
Martin Gelinas.&nbsp; The team was left very weak on defense, but on offense
they are one of the best around.</p>

<p align="left"><b>Youth to Watch:</b>&nbsp; Jason Spezza should have a breakout
season at any time now.&nbsp; This season he should be a regular starter with
the Senators.&nbsp; It is likely he will be on the fourth line however with Petr
Shatslivy and Magnus Arvedson.&nbsp; Spezza will make is break onto the CEHL
scene this season and will begin to form onto the superstar player he is
anticipated to be.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left"><b>Expectations and Prediction:</b>&nbsp; The Senators are
packing a high powered offense that will be counted on to carry the team.&nbsp;
They are very weak on defense and Patrick Lalime will play the biggest role on
this team that he has ever played.&nbsp; The offense will be counted on for the
team to do well.&nbsp; Lalime is going to carry the Senators defense believe it
or not.&nbsp; They are extremely weak on the blue line, and it is likely Lalime
will face among the most shots per game out of any goalie.&nbsp; Ottawa should
improve over last season's disappointment.&nbsp; However, it may be deceiving
just how good they are.&nbsp; Up front they have a superstar lineup, but on
defense they are very thin.&nbsp; Only time will tell what these moves actually
did to the team.&nbsp;<b>3rd in Northeast.&nbsp; 4th in Eastern Conference.</b></p>

<p align="left"><a href="./cehlRosters.html#Philly"><img src="flyers.gif" width="100" height="38"></a><b>Philadelphia
Flyers&nbsp;</b></p>

<p align="left"><b>Season 1:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;No one knows what went wrong with
the Flyers in season 1.&nbsp; They were easily the years biggest
disappointment.&nbsp; The Flyers had what seemed to be a well balanced offense
and defense, and a goalie that could get them to the playoffs.&nbsp; However the
team was never able to get off the ground.&nbsp; Their offense was slow, the
defense ended up having holes, and Chechmanek never played up to his
potential.&nbsp; The Flyers made a mini late season charge which proved to be
insignificant in the end.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left"><b>Offseason:</b>&nbsp; The Flyers decided to stand their ground
in the offseason.&nbsp; The did not sign anyone this offseason but lost a couple
players to free agency.&nbsp; The Flyers did not need to do too much because GM
Mike Garofolo is happy with the young team he has set up.</p>

<p align="left"><b>Youth to Watch:</b>&nbsp; The Flyers have a load of youth to
look out for this season.&nbsp; At forward they have young Tuomo Ruutu.&nbsp; He
is among the top 50 CEHL prospects and will likely start the season on the third
line with Donald Brashear and Pavel Vorobiev.&nbsp; The Philly defense is nearly
all young talent.&nbsp; Joni Pitkanen, Jeff Woywitka, and Ryan Whitney will all
play key roles on the Flyers defense corps this season.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left"><b>Expectations and Prediction:</b>&nbsp; The Flyers have lost
some talent they had at the beginning of season 1.&nbsp; Coming into season 2 it
looks as though they are on their way through a youth movement.&nbsp; But they
should still be able to compete with the leagues playoff teams.&nbsp; The Flyers
will take a run at the playoffs, but with lack of depth all around, and a shaky
goaltender, don't expect to see them advance into the playoffs.&nbsp; <b>4th in
Atlantic.&nbsp; 12th in Eastern Conference.</b></p>

<p align="left"><a href="./cehlRosters.html#Phoenix"><img src="coyotes.gif" width="100" height="38"></a><b>Phoenix
Coyotes&nbsp;</b></p>

<p align="left"><b>Season 1:</b>&nbsp; The Coyotes had an average season
1.&nbsp; They made a deadline deal to land Owen Nolan from San Jose, which they
hoped would boost them into the playoffs.&nbsp; With 2 games to go the Coyotes
were in 8th place by 1 point over Detroit.&nbsp; However, the team lost their
last 2 games while Detroit won theirs.&nbsp; Detroit went onto post season play
while the Coyotes were sent home.</p>

<p align="left"><b>Offseason:</b>&nbsp; The Coyotes got younger this offseason.&nbsp;
They signed 3 players from the Minnesota Wild, and made some interesting
trades.&nbsp; The first one saw Owen Nolan get shipped out of town.&nbsp; Many
people thought he would be the center of this franchise for the next few years
after he was dealt for at the trade deadline, but turned out to be a
rent-a-player.&nbsp; Later, the Coyotes dealt for star Jaromir Jagr who is now
going to be the franchise player.&nbsp; They will count on his offensive
capabilities to bring Phoenix to the promised land.&nbsp; Also the Coyotes
needed a goaltender after losing Byron Dafoe to the free agent market, and
acquired Roman Turek from the Calgary Flames.&nbsp; The Coyotes also made some
moves to bring in youth to the team.&nbsp; Paul Mara is out as the teams future
star defenseman, but Nick Boynton was brought in to take his place.&nbsp;
Overall the Coyotes look like they have improved this offseason, and should be a
team to watch out for this season.</p>

<p align="left"><b>Youth to Watch:</b>&nbsp; The Coyotes have a lot of young
talent waiting to burst onto the scene.&nbsp; Last year in Buffalo, Nick Boynton
broke onto the scene.&nbsp; Phoenix also have Jamie Lundmark, Kurt Sauer, Martin
Podlesak and Tomas Kloucek who should begin to develop very soon.&nbsp; However,
for this season the one to watch is Kris Kolanos.&nbsp; Kolanos will likely
start the season one the Coyotes' second line with Brian Savage and Andreas
Johansson.&nbsp; Kolanos will be expected to put up good numbers for Phoenix
this season.&nbsp; Management and fans both feel this is Kolanos' year to
shine.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left"><b>Expectations and Prediction:</b>&nbsp; The Coyotes look like
an all around better team heading into Season 2.&nbsp; Jaromir Jagr should boost
the teams offense, and also the Coyotes have a stronger defense that centers
around Boynton and Kubina.&nbsp; The Coyotes will likely again make a playoff
charge.&nbsp; Management has promised fans another fight to the finish.&nbsp; In
net Roman Turek is a good successor for the recently departed Byron Dafoe.&nbsp;
However, Turek is not known for playoff play and it will be interesting to see
what happens if they make it there.&nbsp; <b>4th in Pacific.&nbsp; 11th in
Western Conference.</b></p>

<p align="left"><a href="./cehlRosters.html#Pittsburgh"><img src="penguins.gif" width="100" height="38"></a><b>Pittsburgh
Penguins&nbsp;</b></p>

<p align="left"><b>Season 1:</b>&nbsp; The Penguins were an offensive
masterpiece in season 1.&nbsp; Unfortunately they were also a defensive
disaster.&nbsp; The Penguins came on very strong in the second half of the
season, turning from a 12th place team into a 6th place team.&nbsp; In the
playoffs they met the New Jersey Devils in round 1.&nbsp; The Penguins poured on
the offense in a couple games, but for the most part the strong New Jersey
defense was able to shut it down.&nbsp; Mario Lemieux was held pointless in the
series.&nbsp; Despite this, the Penguins held in tough with the Devils and sent
the series to 6 games before losing at home.&nbsp; As the team left the ice,
fans gave them a standing ovation, as no one expected them to even make the
playoffs, and chants of &quot;Comeback Mario&quot; shook the Igloo.</p>

<p align="left"><b>Offseason:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; The Penguins realized their need
to improve on defense this offseason, and did a pretty good job to fix it.&nbsp;
On the free agent market, the Penguins won the Scott Neidermayer sweepstakes, by
signing him to a huge contract.&nbsp; Also, they wanted to improve in net so
that less pressure would be put on the defense.&nbsp; Pittsburgh made a huge
trade with the Detroit Red Wings in which they got Curtis Joseph and two other
players for Ruuchin, Boucher and Kravchuk.&nbsp; The Penguins also acquired
Bates Battaglia in a deal that saw Johan Hedberg leave town.&nbsp; Overall the
Penguins improved their defense and goaltending, which makes them an improved
team heading into season 2.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left"><b>Youth to Watch:</b>&nbsp; Joseph Melichar looks like he is
developing into a good defender.&nbsp; He will start the year on Pittsburgh's
2nd defense pairing and will be given a chance to show off his talents.&nbsp; He
is a stay at home defenseman and, when he throws his body around, is very tough
to beat.&nbsp; Look for Melichar to be a huge factor to success for the Penguins
defense this year, and he should make an even better name for himself.&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left"><b>Expectations and Prediction:</b>&nbsp; The Penguins have
improved themselves this offseason.&nbsp; Mario Lemieux will continue to be the
cornerstone of this franchise.&nbsp; However, the Penguins now have another
player capable of carrying a team.&nbsp; Curtis Joseph carried the young Red
Wings into the playoffs last season, and should do the same with
Pittsburgh.&nbsp; Joseph has a very strong offense to support him.&nbsp; Overall
the Penguins should be watched closely in the East and will be a contender this
season.&nbsp; <b>1st in Atlantic.&nbsp; 3rd in Eastern Conference.</b></p>
