<br><br>
<a name="Sec1D"><b><u>1E – Player Rerates</u></b></a><br>
<br><br>
i.)	CEHL Re-rates will occur twice each season: In the offseason, and again at mid-season. All re-rates will be conducted by the commissioner and his delegates. Their decisions are final and cannot be appealed. Players will be re-rated on their NHL performance only; CEHL performance will not factor into re-rates.<br>
ii.) GMs will be allowed to request a maximum of 5 players at midseason rerates. If 5 positive rerates are requested then as many as 5 negative rerates may be applied if enough players are found applicable.<br>
iii.) During offseason rerates any number of players per team may be rerated up or down as required.<br>
<br><br><br><br>
<a name="Sec2"><h1>Section 2: Team Management</h1></a>
<br><br>
<a name="Sec2A"><b><u>2A – Submitting Lines</u></b></a><br>
<br><br>
i.)	All lines will be submitted to league commissioner Ryan Williams via email. You can use the old GM Editor or the online GM Editor. You are required to dress a minimum of 17 skaters and 2 goalies in your lineup for each game. You must dress at least 3 centers, 3 left wingers, 3 right wingers, 4 defencemen and 2 goalies to meet the minimum positional requirements of the FHL sim.<br>
<br><br>
<a name="Sec2B"><b><u>2B – Trades</u></b></a><br>
<br><br>
i.)	Trades must be emailed to the commissioner by both teams. All trades submitted are final once they have been updated on the site. Please title all trade emails "TRADE Team A/Team B"<br>
ii.) The trade deadline is at the 85% mark of the season.<br>
iii.) You cannot trade a player who has zero years left on his contract and is an unrestricted free agent. RFAs may be traded as their rights still have a value. Any Group IV Free Agent signed during the free agency period CANNOT be traded until after the all-star break of the upcoming season.<br>
iv.) Future considerations are not to be allowed in any trades.<br>
v.)	Any trade which is deemed to be unfair by GM can be appealed to the trade review panel within 48 hours of the trade being posted. The CEHL trade review panel consists of Ryan Williams, Shawn Lawrence and Kevin Lepointe<br>
<br><br>
<a name="Sec2C"><b><u>2C – Draft</u></b></a><br>
<br><br>
i.)	Drafts are held once every two CEHL seasons. Draft positioning will be determined using the combined standings of both seasons. There is no lottery. There will be 7 draft rounds. You will be able to choose for the first 4 rounds, and the rest will be automatically completed. Also, the draft picks for rounds 5 through 8 can not be traded.<br>
<br><br>
<a name="Sec2D"><b><u>2D – Position Changes</u></b></a><br>
<br><br>
i.)	If you want to change a player's listed position in the sim, you must ensure that the player is eligible to play that position. TSN.ca is used to determine eligibility.<br>
ii.) Player position change requests based on the position listings at hockeydb.com or nhl.com will NO longer be accepted.<br>
<br><br>
<a name="Sec2E"><b><u>2E – Retirements</u></b></a><br>
<br><br>
i.)	Players in the CEHL will retire when the player announces his retirement from the NHL.<br>
ii.) Former NHLers playing in Europe may remain in the CEHL.<br>
iii.) Should a player announce his retirement once the CEHL trading deadline has passed, the player will not retire from the CEHL until the end of the season.<br>
<br><br>
<a name="Sec2F"><b><u>2F – Waivers</u></b></a><br>
<br><br>
i.)	Once a player has played 10 games in a regular season and is 24 or older, he can't be moved down to the farm team unless he clears waivers. Every team has the opportunity to claim a player when he is placed on waivers. Should more than one team make a claim on a waived player, the team who has the lowest winning percentage will be given priority. Intentionally stashing a player at the start of the season on your pro roster, and then demoting him to farm, and bypassing waivers is not allowed. This offence carries a minimum fine of $1,000,000. <br>
ii.) If you start the regular season with a player 24 and over on your farm roster who played more than 18 pro games the past season, that player must be entered in the waiver draft preceeding the start of the regular season.<br>
<br><br>
<a name="Sec2G"><b><u>2G – Player Creation</u></b></a><br>
<br><br>
i.)	A prospect must be created if they have reached 100 NHL games played.<br>
<br><br>
<a name="Sec3"><h1>Section 3: Revenue</h1></a>
<br><br>
<a name="Sec3A"><b><u>3A –General Revenue</u></b></a><br>
<br><br>
i.)	As the general manager/owner of a CEHL team, it is your responsibility to ensure your team remains profitable. At the end of any season in which your team has negative cash balance, you will be required to bring your team's balance to at least 0 by the start of the following season or you will lose control of your team.<br>
<br><br>
<a name="Sec3B"><b><u>3B – Cap Limit</u></b></a><br>
<br><br>
i.)	The Salary Cap is set at $53,000,000.<br>
ii.) The salary cap is enforced between the first day of the regular season until teams are eliminated from the playoffs. Teams can exceed the salary cap during the offseason.<br>
iii.) Any team that is judged to be over the cap at the start of the season will have players waived by the commissioner in order to ensure their compliance with the salary cap. During the season, if your team is found to be over the cap, the commissioner will send a player to the minors in order to put you under the cap. This player may as a result be forced to clear waivers.<br>
<br><br>
<a name="Sec3C"><b><u>3C – Fund Sharing</u></b></a><br>
<br><br>
i.)	Funds will be distributed to non-playoff teams with current funds $10 million and under.<br>
ii.) A team that is receiving fund sharing shall not exceed a balance of $10 million after fund sharing money is distributed. Any excess which that team should have received will be contributed to the fund sharing pool to be distributed among other eligible teams.<br>
iii.) The amount given to revenue sharing depends on the teams current funds following the completion of the playoffs.<br>
<br><br>
$20-30 mil donate $1 million to fund sharing<br>
$30-40 mil donate $2 million<br>
$40-50 mil – donate $3 million<br>
$50-60 mil - donate $4 million<br>
$60-70 mil - donate $5 million<br>
70-80 mil - donate $6 million<br>
80-90 mil - donate $7 million<br>
$90-100 mil - donate $8 million<br>
$100-110 mil - donate $9 million<br>
$110+ mil - donate $10 million<br>
***Please note that theses amounts are now calculated via a formula, the dollar value owed increases as you get closer to the higher range. (i.e 20M owes 1M, 25M owes 1.5M, 30M owes 2M) ***<br>
<br><br>
iv.)	Any fines collected during the preseason, season and playoffs will be contributed to the fund sharing pool to be distributed to eligible teams.<br>
<br><br>
<a name="Sec3D"><b><u>3D – Preseason Money</u></b></a><br>
<br><br>
i.)	Each team will receive $2,000,000 in funds at the end of the pre-season. This money is intended to compensate teams due to the fact that actual pre-season revenue is not counted due to a glitch in the sim.<br>
<br><br>
<a name="Sec4"><h1>Section 4: Free Agents &amp; Contracts</h1></a>
<br><br>
<a name="Sec4A"><b><u>4A – Negotiations</u></b></a><br>
<br><br>
i.)	All contract negotiations for extensions or free agents must be done through the player agents. Currently Ryan Williams is the Atlantic &amp; Southeast division agent, along with players on the unassigned list (during the season). Cory Williams is the Northeast division agent.  Colin March is the Central division agent. Andrew Moorehead is the Pacific division agent. Shawn Lawrence is the Northwest division agent. Jeremy Wall is the coaches agent and handles the unassigned list during the off-season.<br>
<br><br>
<a name="Sec4B"><b><u>4B - Agent Decisions</u></b></a><br>
<br><br>
i.)	Agents have the right to request trades for their client, or have his client hold out (only in the last year of a contract). When an agent requests a trade, the GM can choose whether to act on the request. If a GM decides not to trade the player, the agent will decide what further action he will take on behalf of his client. The agent will notify you in the offseason if a player plans on holding out.<br>
<br><br>
<a name="Sec4C"><b><u>4C – Free Agent Classification</u></b></a><br>
<br><br>
i.)	When a contract expires, a player becomes a free agent, depending on the age of the player. There are four different groups of free agency and they are listed below:<br>
<br><br>
Group I Free Agents- These are players who were undrafted and are not signed by a CEHL team. They must be 20 years of age or older for North American born players. They must be 22 years of age or older for European born players. They can be signed by anybody to their farm team at any time of the season. All you have to do to obtain one of these players' rights is to claim the player by emailing the commissioner with the player's name. However, should this player later be found to already exist on another team's roster, you will lose the player's rights (since you really never had them) and your team will be fined $1,000,000, so be careful with these players. These players can be claimed on a first come, first served basis.<br>
Group II Free Agents- This group is commonly known as Restricted Free Agents. Restricted Free Agents can be signed on the open market through the agents, but there are restrictions. If you sign a RFA, his old team can match your offer. The matching offers must work out to the same length and average salary (combination of salary and signing bonus is allowed). Also, compensation will be awarded if to the old team should they decided to pass on the chance to match the offer.<br>
<br><br>
For 84+ players, you must give the other team 5 first round draft picks, at least one must be a pick in the upcoming draft.<br>
For 82+ players you must give the other team 4 first round draft picks, at least one must be a pick in the upcoming draft.<br>
For 80+ players you must give the other team 3 first round draft picks, at least one must be a pick in the upcoming draft.<br>
For 78+ players you must give the other team 2 1st round draft picks, at least one must be a pick in the upcoming draft.<br>
For 76+ players you must give the other team 1 1st round draft pick, it has to be from the upcoming draft.<br>
For 74+ players you must give the other team 1 1st round draft pick, it must be a pick in one of the next two drafts.<br>
For 72+ players you must give the other team 1 2nd round pick, it has to be from the upcoming draft.<br>
For 70+ players you must give the other team 1 3rd round pick, it has to be from the upcoming draft.<br>
For 68+ players you must give the other team 1 4th round pick, it has to be from the upcoming draft.<br>
For players 67 and under, there is no draft pick compensation. However, matching rights still apply.<br>
<br><br>
Compensation draft picks must be taken from the next upcoming draft.<br>
<br><br>
Group III Free Agents- This group is for players who have just been drafted but not yet signed. Any team may sign these players once they reach the age of 22.<br>
Group IV Free Agents- These are players are unrestricted free agents. They can be signed by any team with no matching rights or compensation for the player's old team. These are players who are 27 years old or older. This group also includes players 26 and under that are currently holdouts (listed on the rosters page as HO). If you sign one of these players during the free agency period, you are not allowed to trade them until after the all-star break of the upcoming season.<br>
<br><br>
<a name="Sec4D"><b><u>4D – Maximum Unrestricted Free Agent Signing</u></b></a><br>
<br><br>
i.)	Teams may only resign 4 of their players eligible for unrestricted free agency.<br>
<br><br>
<a name="Sec4E"><b><u>4E – Signing Bonus Restriction</u></b></a><br>
<br><br>
i.)	The signing bonus in a contract should be no larger than three times the annual salary. So if you sign for five years with a $5,000,000 annual salary, the signing bonus cannot be any more than $15,000,000. Also note that signing bonuses are not factored against the salary cap.
<br><br>
<a name="Sec4F"><b><u>4F – Unrestricted Free Agent Minimum Contracts</u></b></a><br>
<br>
i.)	This is the minimum amount a UFA (27 and over) player is required to be offered to re-sign.<br>
