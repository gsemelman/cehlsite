iv.) Should a player retire after a player is resigned during the season, the signing bonus for the contract that will kick in the subsequent season will be refunded<br>

Intentionally stashing a player at the start of the season on your pro roster, and then demoting him to farm, and bypassing waivers is not allowed. This offence carries a minimum fine of $1,000,000. <br>

iii.) Requests made after the day the player turns 22 will be on a first come first serve basis<br>
iv.) Requests made on the day of a players birthday will be subject to a 24 waiting period in which other teams can also submit a claim.
If multiple teams make a request on the same player in this period the tiebreak will be the highest submitted base salary offer. A further tie will be decided based on whomever submitted their offer first.
<br>
<br>
<b>Group II Free Agents</b>- This group is commonly known as Restricted Free Agents. Restricted Free Agents can be signed on the open market through the agents, but there are restrictions. If you sign a RFA, his old team can match your offer. The matching offers must work out to the same length and average salary (combination of salary and signing bonus is allowed).
